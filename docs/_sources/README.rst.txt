Uniform B-spline
================

An implementation of a uniform B-spline from
:math:`\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m`. Uniform means, that
the knot vector of the B-spline is equally distributed. Using such a
knot vector makes the computation much more efficient, as the basis can
be precomputed.
